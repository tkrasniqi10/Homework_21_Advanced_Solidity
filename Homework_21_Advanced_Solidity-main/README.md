In this assignment, a crowdsale contract is created that mints PupperCoin (ERC20). In the contract, Crowdsale, MintedCrowdsale, CappedCrowdsale, TimedCrowdsale, RefundableCrowdsale, and RefundableCrowdsale were the inherent properties. The PupperCoinSale starts minting and renoucing after compiling and testing the crowdsale, using Ganache and Metamask to test the contracts. 
\\\
The address information for the PupperCoin is stored by the PupperCoinSaleDeployer, which the PupperCoinSale uses for deploymnet. For the open and close times, once it is deployed, the open time is set to now and the close is set to 24 weeks later, and the PupperCoin contrat is run using the name, symbol, and inital_supply parameters. 
\\\
The PupperCoin and PupperCoinSale contracts were tested and deployed under the Localhost Metamask Testnet, were the name was set as PupperCoin, the symbol was PUP and the inital_supply was set to 1000000000000000000.
